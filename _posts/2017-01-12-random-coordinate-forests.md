title: "Random Coordinate Forests"
---

I have a method of increasing the accuracy of random forests by changing
coordinates in feature space before each tree fits or predicts.  I'll do more
with this in the future, but for now,
see
[here](https://github.com/mikebenfield/portfolio/blob/master/Random%20Coordinate%20Forests.ipynb).
