Hi! I'm Michael Benfield. I'm a mathematician interested in lots of stuff
related to data science: Bayesian statistics, machine learning, probability
theory, algorithms. I also like a lot of other mathematical topics, and I like
to write code. I'm currently teaching at San Diego State University. If you'd
like to work with me, send me an email and let's see if we can work something
out.

On this blog, I'll write about any of the above topics or whatever else I may be
thinking about at the time. I'll probably be all over the map, with lots of
eclectic content, with some posts at an elementary level and other posts for
experts. Thus the target audience for the blog as a whole is no one.
