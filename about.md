I'm a mathematician interested in lots of stuff related to data science:
Bayesian statistics, machine learning, probability theory, algorithms. I also
like a lot of other mathematical topics, and I sometimes like to write some
code.

I'll write about any of the above topics or whatever else I may be thinking
about at the time. I'll probably be all over the map, with lots of eclectic
content, with some posts at an elementary level and other posts for experts.
Thus the target audience for the blog as a whole is no one.
